        <h1>Privacy Policy for Oxygenie</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: 1st August 2024</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Rory Flint ("we", "our", or "us") respects the privacy of our users
          ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
          disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Oxygenie
          mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy
          carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy,
          please do not access the App.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Location Information</h3>
        <p>
          We collect your device's location data to provide you with accurate
          air quality information for your area. This location data is used
          solely to retrieve air quality data from our third-party API provider
          (https://open-meteo.com/) and is not stored or logged by us in any
          way.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use your location data for the sole purpose of providing you with
          relevant air quality information. We do not use this information for
          any other purpose, nor do we store or track this data.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal
          information with third parties. The only exception is that we send
          your location data to our API provider (https://open-meteo.com/) to
          retrieve air quality data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We do not retain or store any of your personal information, including
          your location data. Each time you use the App, your current location
          is used to fetch air quality data and is then immediately discarded.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

          data. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy
          practices of this third-party service. We encourage you to review
          their privacy policy for more information on how they handle data.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we
          strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However,
          please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or
